Noteworthy changes in version 1.4-g10-1 (2008-04-30)
----------------------------------------------------

  The old Windows port of adns did not worked very well (tcp
  connections have probably never been used) and it was not possible
  to build it from a POSIX box.  To make the porting and maintaining
  easier the build system has been updated to make use of automake and
  libtool.  Adding a bit of windows support was then easy.

  The package is available at: ftp://ftp.g10code.com/g10code/adns/.


 * New function adns_free which is nothing but a wrapper around free.
   Only needed under Windows in certain settings.  It does not harm to
   use it always.

 * Symbol versioning is now implemented.

 * When updating the regression test suite new tests need to be added
   to one of the new automake include files.

 * New files ChangeLog, AUTHORS and NEWS as demanded by GNU standards.
   The old changelog has been renamed to changelog.Debian.
